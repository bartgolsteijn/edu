[apko](http://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko) is a command-line tool that allows users to build container images using a declarative language based on YAML.

apko is so named as it uses the [APK](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Package_management) package format and is inspired by the [ko](https://github.com/google/ko) build tool.

The following image contains an overview of the apko ecosystem and how it interacts with melange for building apk-based images, using either Alpine or Wolfi as base system.
